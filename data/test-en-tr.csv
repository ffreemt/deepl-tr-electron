Chapter 2,第二章
 Chinese,  中文
"Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however (N.B. I dine between twelve and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five), on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk, arrived at Heathcliff's garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.",昨天下午，雾气弥漫，天气寒冷。我有一半的心思在我的书房火炉旁度过，而不是穿过荒野和泥泞去呼啸山庄。然而，当我吃完晚饭上来时（注：我在12点到1点之间吃饭；管家是个母性十足的女士，被当作房子的固定资产，不能或不愿理解我的要求，即在5点为我服务），带着这种懒散的意图上楼，踏进房间时，我看到一个女仆跪在地上，周围是刷子和煤铲，她用成堆的煤渣熄灭火焰，引起一阵阵可怕的灰尘。这一景象使我立即回过头来；我拿着帽子，走了四英里后，来到希斯克利夫的花园门口，正好躲过了第一场雪的羽毛状飘落。
"On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.",在那座荒凉的山顶上，大地被黑色的霜打得很硬，空气让我的每一个肢体都在颤抖。由于无法取下铁链，我跳了过去，跑上旗杆的便道，边上是零星的鹅莓树丛，我徒劳地敲着门，直到我的指关节发麻，狗也在嚎叫。
"`Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated mentally, `you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day time. I don't care--I will get in!' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently. Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.","""可怜的囚犯们！我在心里默默地说，""你们应该永远与你们的物种隔离，因为你们无耻的不友善。至少，我不会在白天把我的门闩起来。我不在乎--我会进去的！' 我下定决心，抓住门闩，猛烈地摇晃。醋脸的约瑟夫从谷仓的一个圆窗里露出头来。"
"`Whet are ye for?' he shouted. `T' maister's dahn i' t' fowld. Go rahnd by th' end ut' laith, if yah went tuh spake tull him.'","他喊道：""你们是干什么的？先生在谷仓里呆着呢。如果你去跟他说话，就从巷子尽头走过去。"
"`Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively.","""里面没有人开门吗？""我回应道。"
`They's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll nut oppen't an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght.',`他们除了小姐之外，没有其他人了；你可以在晚上之前把你的衣服脱掉。
"`Why? Cannot you tell her who I am, eh, Joseph?'",`为什么？你不能告诉她我是谁，嗯，约瑟夫？
"`Nor-ne me! Aw'll hae noa hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing.","""我也不说！""。我们不会有任何麻烦的，'头儿嘀咕着，消失了。"
"The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal shed, pump, and pigeon cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment, where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the `missis', an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.","雪开始下得很厚。我抓住把手想再试一次；这时，一个没穿大衣的年轻人扛着干草叉，出现在后面的院子里。他招呼我跟他走，在走过一个盥洗室和一个有煤棚、水泵和鸽子笼的铺面后，我们终于来到了以前接待我的那个巨大、温暖、愉快的房间。在由煤、泥炭和木头组成的巨大火堆的光芒中，它发出了令人愉快的光芒；在为丰盛的夜餐而摆放的桌子旁边，我高兴地看到了 ""小姐""，一个我以前从未怀疑过的人的存在。我鞠躬等待，以为她会请我入座。她看着我，靠在椅背上，一动不动，哑口无言。"
"`Rough weather!' I remarked. `I'm afraid, Mrs Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.'",恶劣的天气！我说。恐怕，希斯克利夫夫人，这扇门必须承担你的仆人们闲暇时的后果。我费了好大劲才让他们听到我说话。
"She never opened her mouth. I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.",她从未开口。我盯着看--她也盯着看：无论如何，她的眼睛一直盯着我，态度冷淡，不管不顾，让人非常尴尬和不快。
"`Sit down,' said the young man gruffly. `He'll be in soon.'",`坐下，'年轻人粗声粗气地说。`他很快就会进来。
"I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.",我听从了他的命令，并叫来了小人朱诺，在这第二次见面时，朱诺同意移动一下她的尾巴的最顶端，以示对我的认识。
"`A beautiful animal!' I commenced again. `Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?'",`一个美丽的动物！' 我又开始了。`你打算和这些小家伙分开吗，夫人？
"`They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.",`它们不是我的，'这位和蔼可亲的女主人说，比希斯克利夫本人的回答更令人讨厌。
"`Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.",`啊，你最喜欢的是这些吗？ '我继续说，转向一个不起眼的垫子，上面摆满了类似猫的东西。
`A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.,`一个奇怪的选择！'她轻蔑地说道。
"Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.",不幸的是，那是一堆死兔子。我再一次缩了缩脖子，走近壁炉，重复了我对夜晚的野性的评论。
"`You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.","她说：""你不应该出来，""她站起来，从烟囱里拿出两个油漆罐子。"
"Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, they would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn, and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his gold.",她之前的位置避开了光线；现在，我清楚地看到了她的整个身材和面容。她身材苗条，显然刚过而立之年：外形令人赞叹，是我有幸看到的最精致的小脸；五官小巧，非常白皙；亚麻色的发圈，或者说是金色的，松散地挂在她精致的脖子上；眼睛，如果它们的表情令人满意，就会让人无法抗拒：幸运的是，对于我易感的心，它们唯一表现出来的情感徘徊在蔑视和一种绝望之间，在那里被发现是非常不自然的。罐子几乎在她够不着的地方；我做了一个帮助她的动作；她转向我，就像一个守财奴如果有人试图帮助他数金子一样。
"`I don't want your help,' she snapped; `I can get them for myself.'",`我不需要你的帮助，'她呵斥道；`我可以自己去拿它们。
`I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply.,`请你原谅！' 我急忙回答。
"`Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.",`你被邀请去喝茶吗？'她问道，在她整齐的黑色连衣裙上系上围裙，拿着一勺子叶子站在锅上准备着。
"`I shall be glad to have a cup,' I answered.",`我很高兴能喝上一杯，'我回答。
`Were you asked?' she repeated.,"她重复道：""你被要求了吗？"
"`No,' I said, half smiling. `You are the proper person to ask me.'",`没有，'我说，半笑着。`你才是问我的合适人选。
